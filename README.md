# ops-playbook

Hands-on labs and troubleshooting case studies in networking and Linux.  
Built as part of my CCNA + LFCS learning path to document practical troubleshooting, automation, and diagnostic workflows.

---

## Focus Areas
- Network fundamentals (IP, NAT, VLANs, routing)
- Linux systems (services, logs, permissions)
- Packet capture & analysis (Wireshark, tcpdump)
- Troubleshooting automation (Bash scripting, diagnostics)
- Support process refinement (ITIL-style RCA templates)

## Labs & Case Studies
| Title | Category | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| [Lab 1 – Connectivity Test](./labs/network-connectivity-test.md) | Networking | Verifying basic LAN communication and DNS resolution |
| [Lab 2 – Linux Service Recovery](./labs/linux-service-recovery.md) | Linux | Diagnosing and restoring failed SSH service |
| [Case Study – Packet Lost in Translation](./case-studies/packet-lost.md) | Networking | Debugging failed pings due to subnet mismatch |

---

## Tools
- Cisco Packet Tracer / Wireshark  
- Ubuntu Server / Windows 10 (VirtualBox)  
- Bash, PowerShell, Git, Markdown  

---

## Learning Roadmap
Currently progressing through:
- **CCNA** – Networking Foundations  
- **LFCS** – Linux Administration  
- **ITIL Foundation** – Support process & RCA structure

*Every week, I publish one new lab or troubleshooting scenario. The goal: reproducible, real-world technical depth.*
